now we have thre ways to configure the viewresolver  for the application

 all the belo methods ahve been done with respect to the internalresource viewresolver 
1:  through application properties  file for the internal resource view resolver 
2: through the usage for the ba annotation method by making the view  resolver class the bean hich would be laucnhed while the application is started 
3: through  the usage for the configuration class using component  annotation for the confgiuration class  and after this wee hav to make the class as the viewresolver class , in this case we have to register the resolvers we have created for the application 

apart  from this we also have the urlbasedviewresolver  which is the superclass for the internalresourceviewresolver


now in this case we ahve the view name as well which is to be passed for the 
return method for the view resolver , for this registration is no required  

application.properties is only for the internalresourceviewresolver  as the view class name , 
we wont  be abl to find inside the application.properties  file 
but setting the view class name is mandatory if we are workling with the urlbasedviewresolver 
but this view  clas congiguration is not mandatory in case for the internal resource view resolver 
 if we dont provide the view class name for the resolver for the bean annotation class , then we get the error as "property  view class is required"

when we use the jsp  - > we use internalresourcfe view reslover
	         tiles - > tiles related  resolver 
	       x tch  - > x tech related view class 		
	etc 
	
we can cheeck all of them inside the view in spring docs 
if we ahve to work with the angular or react , we have to use the internal resource view
resolver, as they are the scripting lannguages, heence we ahve to include them with the 
jsp or html only 
if we use the jstlView as the view class name ,  we must add the jstl jar file in the pom.xml file
whether we use the jstl tag inside the jsp page or not 	

configuring the view  class is not required for the inmternal resource view resolver 
but for others , it is required

most of the industry follow only the intrnalrsourceview resolver 

so in this case  we dont have to set view class name  by dfault as the lvn and physical view name is same in this case 
for making it sprerately, we ahvee to use some other view resolver  such resource Bundleview resolver 
 resource bundle view resolver  would not pass to the xml view resolver in the resolver chaining  for the application
